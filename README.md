Riguels's "Cheat-Sheets"
Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Riguel, aa 40-year-old tech enthusiast from Brazil, and I love software engineering.

This Repository is inspired on [Christian's repository](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/dotfiles). Contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my Linux and mac OS experience.
> Be careful to use this repository, because it may not be as up-to-date as possible. I'm always trying, but I'd like to let you know.
